A bank loan dataset, typically involves a comprehensive collection of information related to loan applications, borrower details, and loan performance.


SQL's Role:



SQL is utilized for:

•	Data Extraction: Retrieving specific data from the database.

•	Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing data for analysis.

•	KPI Calculation: Deriving key performance indicators (KPIs) like good loan vs. bad loan percentages, total funded amounts, and average interest rates.

•	Data Aggregation: Summarizing data for high-level overviews.

Power BI's Role:

Power BI is used for:

•	Data Connection: Connecting to the SQL database to import the prepared data.

•	Data Modeling: Establishing relationships between tables for comprehensive analysis.

•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Creating custom measures and calculated columns for deeper insights.

•	Visualization: Building interactive dashboards with various charts (e.g., line charts for trends, donut charts for distributions, bar charts for comparisons) to present 
loan performance, borrower profiles, and risk assessments.

•	Interactivity: Implementing filters and slicers for dynamic exploration of the data.

•	When working with a bank loan dataset in Power BI and SQL, a wealth of information concerning loan applications, borrower specifics, and loan outcomes is typically involved.
